# sortjscpd

`sortjscpd` is a small command-line helper that runs the `jscpd` duplicate
code detector and sorts its console output and reformats it.


## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```
This installs `sortjscpd` as a stand-alone program.

## Running without installing

```bash
python3 sortjscpd.py --help
```

---

## Usage

```bash
sortjscpd *.swift
sortjscpd --by lines *.swift
sortjscpd --by tokens *.swift
sortjscpd.py --min-tokens 30 *.swift Util/*.swift
```

---

## Examples

`sortjscpd` supports two output styles.  
Choose the format with `--fmt short` or `--fmt long`.

### `--fmt short`
One-line, compact format.  
Shows file and start line only (aligned to fixed width):

```
7 lines,  50 tokens — Views/BasketsView.swift:89     - Views/StocksView.swift:63
9 lines,  62 tokens — Views/StocksDataView.swift:46  - Views/StocksView.swift:36
```

### `--fmt long`
Two-line, detailed format.  
Shows full (line:column) ranges for both files:

```
Views/BasketsView.swift [89:27 - 96:16]                   (7 lines,  50 tokens)
Views/StocksView.swift  [63:11 - 79:03]
```

After the duplicate listing, the statistics table generated by jscpd is printed.

## How it works

All functionality lives in a single Python script:

```
sortjscpd.py
```

The script:
- runs `jscpd` as a subprocess,
- parses its console output,
- extracts clone blocks,
- sorts them according to command-line options, 
- aligns the output,
- and copies the `jscpd` provided summary.

## Remarks

With hindsight, it might have been cleaner to study the `jscpd` source (TypeScript)
and implement this as an internal formatter or extension. For now, this tool
operates purely on the textual output of `jscpd`.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (that is what it was tested with)
- `jscpd` installed and on your PATH

Install jscpd via npm:

```bash
npm install -g jscpd
```
